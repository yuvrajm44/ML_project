# End to end Machine Learning project
# Student Performance Indicator
## Overview
The Student Performance Indicator project aims to analyze how various factors influence student test scores. Using data that includes variables like gender, parental education, ethnicity, and lunch status, this project builds a model to understand which factors significantly impact student performance. By identifying these influences, the project provides insights that could be used to support academic interventions and improve student outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 1,000 student records with 8 columns, capturing demographic and performance-related attributes. Columns are categorized as Categorical or Numerical:

Categorical Columns:
Gender: The gender of the student.
Race/Ethnicity: The student's race or ethnic background.
Parental Level of Education: The highest education level achieved by the student's parent(s).
Lunch: Indicates whether the student receives free/reduced lunch or has a standard lunch.
Test Preparation Course: Indicates if the student completed a test preparation course.

Numerical Columns:
Math Score: The student’s score in math.
Reading Score: The student’s score in reading.
Writing Score: The student’s score in writing.
